# HYgradu - a LaTeX package for theses

This is a LaTeX document class for making a Master's thesis at the University of Helsinki. This template abides by the conventions followed over the years in physics and physics-related disciplines (astronomy, geophysics, meteorology), and has recently been updated to include some changes made to the thesis layout in the 2017 teaching reform (*Big Wheel*).

## Installation

### Simple
Keep the HYgradu.cls file and sinetti.pdf in your working directory when writing the .tex file.

### More general
Add HYgradu.cls and sinetti.pdf to your LaTeX distribution tree to use it from any directory. Of course, this is a package you only usually need once so it's not that important.

## Usage
The simplest way is just to take the template provided with the class file and start editing that.
